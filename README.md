# webapp-template
A Web application template with React, Redux, Material UI, Webpack, and Jest.

Barebones boilerplate, enough to get started working on any front-end application in React/Redux.

## Usage
`npm run start` - Starts the webpack watch build task

`npm run build` - Builds a (mostly) production ready version of the template.

`npm run test` - Runs tests (if provided). No tests are provided in the template, only the infrastructure to run them.
